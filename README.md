# Cloud-Based CRM Application for Ticketing and Issue Resolution

## Overview

This repository contains the source code and resources for a cloud-based Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application developed to streamline issue resolution and customer support. Leveraging Amazon Web Services (AWS), the application enables users to create tickets, report issues, and track their resolution efficiently.

## Technologies and Architecture

### Frontend

- **Tech Stack**: MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)
- **Deployment**: EC2 instances in a public subnet for accessibility.

### Backend

- **Tech**: Node.js
- **Hosting**: EC2 instances within a private subnet for enhanced security.

### Load Balancing and Scaling

- **Load Balancers**: Application Load Balancers distributing traffic across Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability.
- **Autoscaling**: Ensuring resource scalability based on demand.

### Data Storage

- **MongoDB**: Primary database for user data, ticketing info, and issue details.
- **DynamoDB**: Storing user login and authentication tokens for faster access.
- **Amazon Elasticache**: Caching frequently accessed data for improved performance.
- **S3**: Cost-effective storage for static content and backups.
- **EFS**: Shared file system for backend servers.

### Networking and Security

- **VPCs and Subnets**: AZs with dedicated public and private subnets for segregation and security.
- **NAT Gateways**: Controlling outbound internet access from private subnets.
- **Security Groups**: Enforcing granular access control to resources.

### Deployment Automation

- **CodeCommit**: Managing code versions and facilitating streamlined deployments.

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Customer Experience**: Easy ticket creation and tracking leading to improved service.
- **Efficient Issue Resolution**: Streamlined workflow for faster issue resolution.
- **Scalability and Availability**: Autoscaling and multi-AZ deployment ensure reliability.
- **Security and Compliance**: Leveraging AWS services and IAM roles for a secure environment.
- **Cost Optimization**: Utilizing S3, EFS, and autoscaling for cost-effective operations.

## Potential Improvements

- **Database Optimization**: Evaluating the need for multiple databases for better data consistency.
- **Network Optimization**: Consolidating Elasticache for a simplified network topology.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Integrating CloudWatch for comprehensive performance monitoring.
- **Data Backup and Recovery**: Implementing robust backup strategies for all application data.
- **Cost Monitoring**: Regularly reviewing resource usage for cost-saving opportunities.

## Conclusion

This cloud-based CRM application delivered a scalable, secure, and user-friendly platform for issue management and customer support. Leveraging AWS services, the project achieved high availability, performance, and cost-efficiency. Further optimization opportunities exist in database management, network simplification, monitoring, and cost management.
